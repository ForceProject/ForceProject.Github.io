                    <h2>Server Initialised</h2>
                    <p>
                        Called when the server is initiated and will begin listening for incoming device connections immediately after the function is called. It will pass the host name of the server, e.g. <code>192.168.1.3</code>.<br/>
Use this if you want to store the host name of the server or do something with it. You can also do some of your own setup or config here, but it is recommended you do that before you start the server.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Server Received Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        This function is called when a full message is read from the pipe/socket. All values WILL have a value so None checks are not required. The main arguments passed are, the device name of the sending device, the tag of the tile that sent the data, and the data. Note that the server automatically converts all values to the data type they are suppose to be. For example if a switch with tag ‘toggle’ was tapped, the data would be either a <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> boolean object in Python.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Server Received Error</h2>
                    <p>
                        Did receive error is called when something wrong is sent from the server to the client, for example a tile with the tag you sent doesn’t exist, or doesn't accept input. It is up to you to do with the error as you wish. It is a simple string describing what went wrong.
                    </p>

Note that the server has an internal dictionary with all of the client names and instances of the connection. You can find this by doing: <code>&lt;Instance of ForceServer&gt;.clients</code>.

                    <p>
                        Called when there is a keyboard interrupt, as the server is always listening for one. Do any cleaning up here. For example disabling the GPIO pins on a RaspberryPi and calling its cleanup function. By the time this is called, all clients would have been disconnected by the server, this is the very last step before the Python terminates this program.
